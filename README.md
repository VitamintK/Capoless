Why
=======

Because I was tired of transposing chords in my head for every song whose chords were written to be played with a capo.

Also, to learn Javascript and how to make a Chrome extension.  (Shoutout to [Cloud-to-Butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt) because I stole the structure of the code from there.)

Installation
------------

In Chrome, choose Window > Extensions.  Drag capoless.crx into the page that appears.
