<a id="what" class="anchor" href="#what" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What</h2>

<p>Capoless is a Chrome extension that automatically translates the chord names on a page of guitar chords to the chords that they will be after they are capoed.</p>

<h2>
<a id="why" class="anchor" href="#why" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why</h2>

<p>I created this Chrome extension because I'm a piano player who wants to play the chord progressions of pop songs.  Pop song chords are usually most easily accessible through guitar tabs, on sites like <a href="http://www.ultimate-guitar.com">Ultimate-Guitar</a>.  </p>

<p>However, oftentimes chords online are written to be played with a capo, which means each chord is raised a certain amount of half-steps, depending on which fret the capo is placed.  As a piano player, if I want to play the chords in the same original tones, I had to transpose in my head, which was a hassle while playing.</p>

<p>With this Chrome extension, when you visit any page of chords in the Ultimate-Guitar site, the chords will automatically be transposed to whatever capo is listed on the page.</p>

<p>Currently, this only works with chords from the Ultimate-Guitar site, (because that site already has a transpose feature, and so all I had to do was write a parser that finds the capo fret and uses the transpose feature with that amount), but the plan is to make this work anywhere.  </p>

<p>Stay <em>tuned</em>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
