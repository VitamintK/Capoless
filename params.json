{"name":"Capoless","tagline":"Chrome extension to transpose capo-ed guitar chords to their actual, capoless keys!","body":"# Capoless\r\n\r\n## What\r\n\r\nCapoless is a Chrome extension that automatically translates the chord names on a page of guitar chords to the chords that they will be after they are capoed.\r\n\r\n## Why\r\n\r\nI created this Chrome extension because I'm a piano player who wants to play the chord progressions of pop songs.  Pop song chords are usually most easily accessible through guitar tabs, on sites like [Ultimate-Guitar](http://www.ultimate-guitar.com).  \r\n\r\nHowever, oftentimes chords online are written to be played with a capo, which means each chord is raised a certain amount of half-steps, depending on which fret the capo is placed.  As a piano player, if I want to play the chords in the same original tones, I had to transpose in my head, which was a hassle while playing.\r\n\r\nWith this Chrome extension, when you visit any page of chords in the Ultimate-Guitar site, the chords will automatically be transposed to whatever capo is listed on the page.\r\n\r\nCurrently, this only works with chords from the Ultimate-Guitar site, (because that site already has a transpose feature, and so all I had to do was write a parser that finds the capo fret and uses the transpose feature with that amount), but the plan is to make this work anywhere.  \r\n\r\nStay _tuned_!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
